## Optimize diff generation for large documents

   * We can further optimize this by adjusting the chunk size based on document size or content type.

* Parallel processing:
   * Implement parallel processing for diff generation on large documents.
   * Use Python's `multiprocessing` or `concurrent.futures` to distribute the diff computation across multiple CPU cores.

* Memory-efficient diff algorithm:
   * Implement or use a memory-efficient diff algorithm for very large documents.
   * Consider algorithms like Histogram diff or patience diff, which can be more efficient for certain types of content.

* Incremental diff updates:
   * For continuously updated documents, implement an incremental diff system that only computes changes since the last update.

* Compression:
   * Implement compression for diff storage and transmission, especially for large documents.

* Optimized data structures:
   * Use more efficient data structures for storing and manipulating diff data.
   * Consider using specialized libraries like `diff_match_patch` for improved performance.

* Caching and memoization:
   * Implement caching for intermediate results in the diff computation process.
   * Use memoization techniques to avoid redundant calculations.

* Sampling and approximation:
   * For extremely large documents, consider using sampling techniques to approximate diffs quickly.
   * Implement a two-stage diff process: quick approximation followed by detailed diff only where necessary.
