# Web Scraper Enhancement Roadmap

## Implement and Integrate start_scraping_from(url)
- [x] Develop core functionality to start scraping from a specific URL
- [x] Integrate with existing concurrent scraping logic
- [x] Implement error handling and logging for this process
- [x] Test thoroughly with various starting points

## Enhance ProxyManager
- [ ] Implement proxy rotation mechanism
- [ ] Add error handling for proxy failures
- [ ] Integrate with a proxy provider API (if applicable)
- [ ] Implement a method to test proxy health periodically

## Fully Integrate Checksum and Change Detection
- [ ] Refactor main scraping logic to use load_checksum
- [ ] Integrate has_page_changed into decision-making process
- [ ] Optimize to reduce unnecessary downloads and processing
- [ ] Implement caching mechanism for checksums

## Improve Partial Content Updates
- [ ] Fully integrate update_partial_content into main scraping process
- [ ] Implement a robust diff and patch system
- [ ] Add error handling for failed partial updates
- [ ] Develop a fallback mechanism for full content updates when partial fails

## Enhance Pagination Handling
- [ ] Utilize pagination_links from extract_links_selenium
- [ ] Implement a system to prioritize pagination links in the scraping queue
- [ ] Develop logic to handle different pagination styles (e.g., numbered, "Load More" buttons)

## Complete Resume Scrape Functionality
- [ ] Implement start_scraping_from function
- [ ] Ensure proper integration with existing scraping logic
- [ ] Add error handling and logging for the resume process
- [ ] Implement a mechanism to save and load scraping progress

## Integrate Page Prioritization
- [ ] Use prioritize_pages to order the scraping queue
- [ ] Implement dynamic priority adjustment during scraping
- [ ] Develop a scoring system based on multiple factors (update frequency, importance, etc.)

## General Improvements
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling throughout the code
- [ ] Implement a robust logging system for debugging and monitoring
- [ ] Develop unit tests for all critical functions
- [ ] Optimize database operations (consider implementing connection pooling)
- [ ] Implement a cleanup routine for old or unnecessary data
- [ ] Develop a configuration system for easy customization of scraper behavior
- [ ] Implement rate limiting and respect for robots.txt
- [ ] Create a user-friendly command-line interface for controlling the scraper

## Data Quality and Relevance

- [ ] Implement content relevance scoring
- [ ] Add filtering mechanisms for irrelevant content
- [ ] Develop a system to categorize content by topic (e.g., technical analysis, fundamental analysis, market news)

## Time-sensitive Data Handling

- [ ] Implement a system to track and update time-sensitive information
- [ ] Add functionality to archive historical versions of content

## Data Structuring

- [ ] Develop a schema for structured data extraction specific to trading (e.g., stock symbols, price data, economic indicators)
- [ ] Implement named entity recognition for financial entities

## Image and Chart Handling

- [ ] Enhance image processing to extract data from financial charts and graphs
- [ ] Implement OCR for text embedded in images
